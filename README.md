# exam_topics
This was a real gig on upwork .

It was a simple task done by scrapy , neither itemloader nor pipeline were needed as the client simply needed these data saved as a (.csv) file.

The required data to be scraped were the exams whose title contains (PT0-001) from all site's pages.

i created a spreadsheet containing the test's (page number , title , link)
